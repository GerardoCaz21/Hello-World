# Hello-World
Frist repository

For anyone's interest. I'm learning Python, self-taught. I will be sharing all projects, from the first things I learn to do all the way until to getting a job as a Python programmer without a degree. 
This will be challenge though I'm putting my own time and dedication to become a remote programmer. It's the life-style we dream of!
